But the cs could only generate the same hybrid lable that no carrier can take/scan. Then I was told by zara (opened a case) to wait for further investigation. While i was waiting, the orders have passed 30 return window. SO the stores won't refund me either! But it was your fault from the beginning and why would I have to pay for your mistake? As of right now, there is still no solution provided by zara. Please, I want to return and get my refund!"}
{"comment": "Dear Zara Customer Service,\n\nI am writing to formally raise a complaint regarding my recent order. I wish to return the item in accordance with my consumer rights; however, I have been informed that a home collection is required as the item is large, after 3 attempts of trying to get a label sent via your agents on what’s app no courier has has arrived - this is ongoing now for 2 weeks and the window to return the item is closing. \n\nUnder the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, consumers have the right to return goods purchased online within 14 days of receipt for a full refund, including the cost of standard delivery. While retailers may set return methods, these must be fair and reasonable. Forcing a home collection, particularly when alternative return options exist, may not align with these legal requirements.\n\nI kindly request that Zara provide a return option that is both reasonable and compliant with consumer law. If this issue is not resolved satisfactorily, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to Trading Standards and seek further advice from Citizens Advice UK.\n\nPlease confirm how you will proceed with my return at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have sent multiple DM’s which have been ignored and I do not wish to waste my hours contacting your customer service which is absolutely appalling."}

{"comment": "Hi, I received my order from Zara India on 13th Feb(online), & raised a return request by 14th Feb and the parcel was picked up the next day. I never received a confirmation of the pick-up. I only heard from zara on 23rd feb saying they had received the return without the label & I would therefore have to take it back. They told me to give them my address so they can send it back to me.\nThe way returns are usually done, the delivery person quality checks the item to ensure the label is intact before accepting it so how is it possible that in this case he passed it but only when it reached the warehouse did they realize this? This is a complete scam that is happening either by the delivery person or by zara to discourage returning. I have made several online purchases & know better than to do something like this. I need help to speak to the right person & get a fair resolution in this case because this was an item worth 7000, it did not suit me so I do not want to keep it, I can’t forego so much money like this."}

{"comment": "It’s been very troublesome to return an item to Zara, despite I’m someone who is already in apparel industry. The reason is nonchalant behavior of the shop manager; the people/ brands who are already familiar with Turkish market know that our own Turkish brands have quite flexible return policies however apparently the same don’t apply to Inditex brands. I bought the item with the code 53918097624 Zara online which I had already purchased similar style previously from other Inditex brands. Contrary to the previous items, these shoes happened to have very stiff material and have a piping inside. I didn’t mind the stiff material upon purchasing, however piping cut my ankle badly after wearing for a day. When I discussed this with a Zara sales assistant, I’ve been informed that it has 2 year guarantee and can be exchanged. However after going to the store (Mall of Istanbul) for the exchange, the store manager refused my request and claimed that product is not faulty without even having looked into the product which was supposed to be sent for review of the quality team or at least someone who has technical competency on the matter. Saying that if the product was taken in to be reviewed by technical team, I would’ve accepted the outcome after being provided a logical explanation, however I’m not accepting this result neither as a customer nor -as I said- being a professional in the industry. Hence I would like to urgently get a logical explanation for the matter and demand a solution.Thanks"}

Monica you are phenomenal. Keep slaying ladies. XOXO"}

{"comment": "I call bullshit!! At 22 you should be smart enough mature enough to make well informed decisions."}
{"comment": "What the documentary….she knew what she was doing"}
{"comment": "She was an adult. Sh3 knew what she was doing. She knew he was married.  She cannot keep playing the victim cars."}

{"comment": "Omg nothing like digging up things from 30 years ago. Move forward already"}
{"comment": "You don’t get more iconic than this 🙌"}
{"comment": "Laws need to change. There shouldn’t be a statutory bar on sexual harassment cases. Most states say a woman has 1-3 years to file suit from the moment of the alleged harassment. Monica said something so compelling. That it took her years to process her trauma. Think of the thousands of woman who are afraid to come forward and when the time comes where they feel healed enough to, legally they are too late. Our government has and continues to fail sexual harassment victims."}

{"comment": "As someone who’s 44, and was 18ish when this news broke, I remember it vividly. She was smeared EVERYWHERE. For years. Long before social media, this was forced in all of our faces. That she was the bad guy and he was ‘perfect.’ My heart aches for her and I wish there were visuals of how terrible the headlines were. It’s so hard to explain how it was back then. Thank you Alex. You NAILED this. I’m so grateful the daddy gang got to hear this rich history of where we all came from"}
{"comment": "So glad this is being talked about.  I feel similarly about women having to own the responsibility of changing our names back the case of divorce. A mutual relationship didn’t work out and now it’s on the woman to announce it publicly and go through the time, effort and emotional stress to start over."}

{"comment": "Love this. Yet did you know that over 50% of the homeless population are foster children who have aged out of the system & literally have nowhere to go, along with few to no connection to some sort of community. While another large percentage of them make up the prison population.  Their ability to make connections seems limited given what they’ve been through & teaching them to reach out is no easy challenge.  Hoping some see this!"}
{"comment": "People often have no one to talk to or don’t reach out due to fear of judgment, past rejections, social isolation, or simply not knowing who will listen. Modern life, social media, and cultural norms can also make vulnerability feel risky, leading many to suffer in silence."}

{"comment": "Science shows that social connection is a fundamental human need, and body language plays a crucial role in it. Studies indicate that gestures like genuine smiles, eye contact, and open postures enhance empathy and a sense of belonging. When we neglect our relationships, we suffer not only emotionally but also physically loneliness can increase cortisol levels, weaken the immune system, and even reduce life expectancy. Small adjustments in nonverbal communication, such as slightly leaning in when talking or subtly mirroring someone's gestures, can strengthen bonds and create deeper connections. Taking care of your social health starts with signs that speak!"}
{"comment": "3 close relationships???😮😳 I don't even have one 😌🤣🤣🤣🤨"}
{"comment": "Sounds easy to connect, but reality is different when you are different."}
{"comment": "It’s not just interaction. It’s quality of interaction. Lots of people are mentally checked out and it’s no one’s fault except our policies that allowed the ultra rich to become stupid rich and the labor market to not see any ROI."}
{"comment": "So the solution is to give lonely people AI chatbots?? We should come together as a society to support each other. Instead since 9/11/2001 Republicans have torn apart the fabric of the nation with identity politics and hot button issues. The NCAA has maybe 10 transgender athletes out of over 500,000+ people. Is it really protecting women in sports or is it demonizing a minority? And American Values Protect minorities, not exclude them. It's all a smoke screen to take away Your Rights. Wake up!"}
{"comment": "Girls taught combat sport early on might not seem like a solution but ‘tis a powerful tool to self actualise and live bravely in all spheres of life."}
{"comment": "Absolutely 💯🙌🏼 agree with this! I know how to take risks now, but it’s taken me years to unlearn what I was taught as a child and to become brave and fight my need for everything to be perfect. To lean into failure and get up and try again. Great TED Talk for all parents and grandparents to watch."}
{"comment": "This is super interesting!"}
{"comment": "Finally! ❤️ Essential oil diffusers or what have you, for example, are commonly used during massage therapy sessions, sleep, hotels and some clinics or medical facilities to regulate the emotions (or influence the memory) of their service recipients. Would really love to see more research on how the sense of smell influences our experiences, memory and emotions. 😊"}

{"comment": "Feedback, not critique; This script annoys me because of a few turns of phrase, I'm not against fusion as a power source\n\nThe term \"Unlimited\" annoys me, because nothing is unlimited.\nTalking about not having to worry about turning off the lights is a bothering example about power, because of light pollution\n\nI know that those aren't her points behind the terms. But it's like, if I was a cat, this dialogue patted me the wrong way"}
{"comment": "Im not worried about turning off lights"}
{"comment": "Many people have fears of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, but those were fission processes not fusion. Fusion has so much potential, but it needs proper re branding before people can feel comfortable with it as a viable option!"}
