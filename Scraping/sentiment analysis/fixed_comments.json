While retailers may set return methods, these must be fair and reasonable. Forcing a home collection, particularly when alternative return options exist, may not align with these legal requirements.\n\nI kindly request that Zara provide a return option that is both reasonable and compliant with consumer law. If this issue is not resolved satisfactorily, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to Trading Standards and seek further advice from Citizens Advice UK.\n\nPlease confirm how you will proceed with my return at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have sent multiple DM\u2019s which have been ignored and I do not wish to waste my hours contacting your customer service which is absolutely appalling."

I never received a confirmation of the pick-up. I only heard from zara on 23rd feb saying they had received the return without the label & I would therefore have to take it back. They told me to give them my address so they can send it back to me.\nThe way returns are usually done, the delivery person quality checks the item to ensure the label is intact before accepting it so how is it possible that in this case he passed it but only when it reached the warehouse did they realize this? This is a complete scam that is happening either by the delivery person or by zara to discourage returning. I have made several online purchases & know better than to do something like this. I need help to speak to the right person & get a fair resolution in this case because this was an item worth 7000, it did not suit me so I do not want to keep it, I can\u2019t forego so much money like this."

The reason is nonchalant behavior of the shop manager; the people/ brands who are already familiar with Turkish market know that our own Turkish brands have quite flexible return policies however apparently the same don\u2019t apply to Inditex brands. I bought the item with the code 53918097624 Zara online which I had already purchased similar style previously from other Inditex brands. Contrary to the previous items, these shoes happened to have very stiff material and have a piping inside. I didn\u2019t mind the stiff material upon purchasing, however piping cut my ankle badly after wearing for a day. When I discussed this with a Zara sales assistant, I\u2019ve been informed that it has 2 year guarantee and can be exchanged. However after going to the store (Mall of Istanbul) for the exchange, the store manager refused my request and claimed that product is not faulty without even having looked into the product which was supposed to be sent for review of the quality team or at least someone who has technical competency on the matter. Saying that if the product was taken in to be reviewed by technical team, I would\u2019ve accepted the outcome after being provided a logical explanation, however I\u2019m not accepting this result neither as a customer nor -as I said- being a professional in the industry. Hence I would like to urgently get a logical explanation for the matter and demand a solution.Thanks"
